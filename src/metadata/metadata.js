      contents: `
      As new commercial augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets have been developed and released, eye tracking has become a critical feature as a means of user interaction and as a way to determine user behavior and attention. However, there is a lack of a standardized metric for measuring the accuracy of the eye tracking technology built into these headsets. Moreover, we lack a much-needed baseline for evaluating eye tracking when head movement, body movement, and locomotion are involved, as calibration methods are typically designed for stationary settings. We introduce the Meta Quest Pro Eye Tracking Test Suite (EyeTTS). Our goal is to create an eye tracking test suite to evaluate and calibrate eye tracking data, specifically in scenarios with varying degrees of movement, by presenting a stimulus in either a world-stabilized or screen-stabilized scenario. We additionally analyze the effects of presenting the stimulus in a VR environment in contrast to an AR one on a user's visual perception.
